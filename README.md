# To Do

## Add any new features you would like to add to the game

- We need to make some sort of design structure for how we want the game to look
  (we'll work on this together for some prototype)
- We'll have to make some dice pngs for zombie dice - (brains, tracks, shotgun blast)
- Obviously keep track of player and player status (turn, status, dice, etc)
- We have to keep track of the dice: (6 green have 3 brains, 1 shotgun, and 2 runners)
  (4 yellow have 2 of each) (3 red have 1 brain, 3 shotgun, and 2 runner)
- 3 dice are assigned randomly out of 13 (randomly pulling out dice)
- Shots and brains are automatically set aside for the turn
- Allow players to reroll dice (always 3) until they bank brains or get shot 3 times
- If a player is shot 3 times, they lose all brains accumulated that round
- First player to 13 brains wins

# Zombie Dice Game Rules

## How do you play Zombie Dice?

### Game Play

The first player is the one who won the last game, or the one who can say "Braaaaains!" with the most feeling. (this is literally what the website said)

On your turn, shake the cup, take three dice from it without looking, and roll them. Each one is a human victim. The red dice are the toughest. Green are easiest, and yellow are medium tough.

The dice have three symbols:

### Brain

You ate your victim's brain. Set your Brain dice to your left.

### Shotgun

He fought back! Set your Shotgun dice to your right.

### Footprints

Your victim escaped. Keep your Feet dice in front of you. If you choose to roll again, you will re-roll these dice, along with enough new ones to bring the total to three.

If you rolled three shotguns, your turn is over. Otherwise, you can choose to stop and score, or continue. If you decide to stop, score 1 for each Brain you have, and put all the dice back into the cup. It's the next player's turn.

If you choose to keep going, leave all your Feet on the table. Unless all three of your dice are Feet, take enough random new dice from the cup to total three, and roll again. Whenever you roll, you will roll three dice at a time.

After you take new dice, you can't decide to stop... you have to roll. Set aside Brains and Shotguns as above. If you are up to 3 Shotguns, your turn is over and you score nothing.

Otherwise, you can stop and score, or take another roll...

### Brrraains

If you don't have three dice left in the cup, make a note of how many Brains you have and put them all in the cup (keep the Shotguns in front of you). Then continue.

## End of the game

Play until someone reaches 13 Brains. Then finish the round. Whoever has the most Brains at the end of that round is the winner. If there's a tie, the leaders (only) play a tiebreaker round.
